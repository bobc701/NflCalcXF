10/02'19
Removed Android.Runtime.Preserve attribute from MainPage.xaml.cs, and 
removed reference to Mono.Android.dll in the main project. In order to 
fix error MT2001.

---------------- Starting to port to iOS --------------------
Todo:
  -- Spash screen
  -- Icons in Asset file, for forced, etc.
  -- Prov Profile for release - need specific app id? (com.zeemerix.nflcalcxf?)
-------------------------------------------------------------

11/22'18
Made changes for LITE, except launcher icons... do that next.

11/11'18
This gives APK with no linking.
I added launcher_ic icons to mipmap folders - have not tested yet.

7/20x18
Help and About pages opened from navigation bar on main page.
Help uses WebView, but About, not yet.

7/13x18
1807.01:
-- PropertyChange called on ResultIcon property, so badge updates on page return
-- OrigResult used in WeeklySched page so shows ok afetr a simulation.
-- Tan background when weekly sched game is selected, fixed (not flagged)
-- Override honored in PlayGame()


7/12x18
1st set of changes for 1807.01.


7/12x18
This is running in emulator (7.1 API 25) and also Galaxy S7.
I futzed with font sizes and they seem ok. Might need further tweeking, to vary by resolution.
Next:
   Make the list of needed logic changes (1807.01): Schedule page resetting to orig results, etc., etc.


7/9x18
I removed logo from MainPage.
I overhauled the game staus badges so they are round.
I had trouble with Deployment Errors but installed Emilator API 25 and now it runs.
Note: backups prior to this were missing Android & iOS projects :(


7/7x18
I got the splash screen working, with green background to match the splash2.png icon.
Next:
   I want to add a activity indicator on the splash screen.
      (I tried that bu it blew up -- try again)
   I need to remove the logo from the MainPage.
   Can the green color ("#22B14C") somehow be a global style?
   

7/3'18
Figured out hpow to do 2-level Task.Run / await.
This has the approach running in one method (btnWeeklySched_OnClick).
I will now apply it to the other buttons. But return here if you need to restore.
So this is hopefully just a temp grab.


7/2'18
Got both progress bar and now wait cursor (ActivityIndicator) working.
But ActivityInd is using binding, and so I am now going to remove all
the binding pieces because all you have to do is set tIsVisible and IsRunning
properties manulally. This will mean removing the MainPageViewModel, and its 
implementation of INotifyPropertychanged.

DataFetch is working. I found 2 ways of doing it, and chose the way where you
can set the time out. (See EN for the 2 ways.) But I wish I could find a way to quickly
check the connection without waiting for a time-out.

6/28'18
DataFetch logic still in dev.


6/27'18
Got the progress bar working for the full simulation .
Got it to read the 3 files from www.4bcx.com/NflCalcXf, but full DataFetch logic not done.

Next: 
I have mapped out the CSeason.FetchData logic (see EN), and will now overhaul the data reading
for the new approach. 
So this version has the final working version of the old approach.

6/26'18
Fixed so resultsString is reset before single season and simulation, and for single season it
is set to resultsStringTempalte which is just a string no StringBuilder.
Added Zero method to CAccumulator and set t.tots.Zero for each team, prior to simulation.
Started to implement the event SeasonComplete for the progress bar.

6/22'18
Implemented ResultsPage for the full simulation.

6/21'18
Implemented the ResultsPage for single season.
Set up so as to reuse same page  for single season and full.

6/21'18
Got the grid of weekly buttons on the main page running.
Todo:
-- How to eliminate space between buttons.
-- Possible replace the whole thing with a Xaml Grid.
Next:
-- Page to show the results. (Re-use i page for single season & full?)


6/20'18
Got the weekly sched page running with the 3 icons
Got ResultString updated on return from GameDetail page (via INotifyPropertyChange with
explicit argument.)

6/14'18
I got weekly schedule page running, and got it formatted with
white on black text. Looks nice.
Next: Add GameDetailPage, for when game is to be simulated, and let user
click override switches.


6/14'18
This version runs, and it just lists the games from week 10 in string format.
Todo: Bind the ListView to List of actual CGame objects i/o strings.
